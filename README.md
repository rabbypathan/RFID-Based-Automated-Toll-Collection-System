# RFID-Based-Automated-Toll-Collection-System
The main objective of our project is to bring automation on toll collection both. It will collect information from RFID card user and match with stored data. Then if match information it will deduct toll money from that user and allow the car to go away. In Bangladesh, this system hasn't introduced yet. If it can be implemented it will save time and keep the road less busy.
