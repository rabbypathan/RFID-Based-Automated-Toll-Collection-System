# RFID Based Automated Toll Collection System
The main objective of our project is to bring automation on toll collection both. It will collect information from RFID card user and match with stored data. Then if match information it will deduct toll money from that user and allow the car to go away. In Bangladesh, this system hasn't introduced yet. If it can be implemented it will save time and keep the road less busy.

## Hardware System:
- Arduino Uno
- Arduino Mega
- Arduino Ethernet Shield
- RFID (RC522) sensor and card
- Camera OV7670
- LCD Display 16x2
- IIC/I2C Serial Interface Module
- Sonar Sensor
- Buzzer

## Programming Language:
The Arduino runs a simplified version of the C programming language, with some extensions for 
access the hardware.

## Prerequisites:
- Arduino Uno board
- USB programming cable (A to B)
- 9V battery or external power supply (for stand-alone operation)
- Solderless breadboard for external circuits, and 22 g solid wire for connections
- Host PC running the Arduino development environment. Versions exist for Windows, Mac and Linux
